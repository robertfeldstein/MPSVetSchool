Because PIPYN, Early, and Hosp are time-invariant, a within estimation model does not output any of the coefficients.
The only coefficients that get output are the ones that change overtime.

                       data = df24test)

# Drop intercept if present (since 'within' model doesn’t include one)
if ("(Intercept)" %in% colnames(X_test)) {
  X_test <- X_test[, setdiff(colnames(X_test), "(Intercept)"), drop = FALSE]
}

# Ensure column order matches
X_test <- X_test[, names(coefs), drop = FALSE]

# Compute predictions manually

# R-squared and Adjusted R-squared
ss_res <- sum((df24test$medical - prediction)^2)
ss_tot <- sum((df24test$medical - mean(df24test$medical))^2)
r2 <- 1 - ss_res / ss_tot

# Adjusted R²: Note — no intercept in within model
n <- nrow(df24test)
p <- length(coefs)
adj_r2 <- 1 - (1 - r2) * (n - 1) / (n - p - 1)

# Optional: Training performance (if available)
# If you computed training predictions manually, you can do the same for training_mse and training_r2
# Otherwise, omit the print statements or replace with actual values

print(testing_mse)

```

It is not possible to actually make predictions on new individuals. So this code will not run unfortunately.
